        Hi! I'm Marissa Liu, I'm a Toronto based designer committed to bring bold design solutions for enterprises.

My design journey first started in architecture school. By partaking in many design installations such as the Luminato festival, Parklet Project, and Bata Shoe Museum

While making the transition into product design I've been involved in the community by leading events and seminars on the admin team of Design Buddies.
 
I stay up to date with the industry by being a member of TechTO, Design Buddies, and actively participating in rooms on Clubhouse. In my free time you can find me on the water with my dragonboat team, hiking/jog with my two year old Samoyed, or creating digital art ( NFT's anyone?)
